# ADR-001: GitHub OIDC Authentication for AWS Deployment

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need secure, keyless authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS for automated deployments. Traditional approaches using long-lived AWS access keys pose security risks and require manual key rotation.

## Decision
We will use GitHub's OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to authenticate with AWS using short-lived tokens.

## Implementation
- Configure AWS IAM Identity Provider for GitHub OIDC
- Create IAM roles with trust policies scoped to specific repositories and branches
- Use `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action with role assumption

### Trust Policy Security
```json
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:crazybass81/GovChat:ref:refs/heads/main",
      "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Consequences
### Positive
- No long-lived credentials stored in GitHub Secrets
- Automatic token rotation and expiration
- Fine-grained access control per repository/branch
- Audit trail through CloudTrail

### Negative
- Additional setup complexity
- Dependency on GitHub OIDC service availability
- Need to manage IAM role policies
